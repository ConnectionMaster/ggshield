### Added

- A new command is added to IaC scans: `ggshield iac scan ci`. It is meant to simplify using IaC scans in CI environments.
  It allows the same arguments as hook subcommands (in particular, `--all` to perform a scan on the whole repository).
  Supported CIs are: - Azure - Bitbucket - CircleCI - Drone - Github - Gitlab - Jenkins - Travis

### Changed

- Code is shared between iac scan CI and secret scan CI. Commit range functions are now inside `ggshield/core/git_hooks/ci.py`.
