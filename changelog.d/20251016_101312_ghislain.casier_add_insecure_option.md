### Added

- Added `--insecure` CLI option and `insecure` configuration setting as clearer alternatives to `--allow-self-signed` and `allow_self_signed`. The new option explicitly communicates that SSL verification is completely disabled, making the connection vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.
- Added prominent warning messages when SSL verification is disabled (via either `--insecure` or `--allow-self-signed`), explaining the security risks and recommending the secure alternative of using the system certificate trust store (available with Python >= 3.10).

### Security

- Improved clarity around SSL verification settings. The `--allow-self-signed` option name was misleading as it suggests certificate validation is still performed, when in reality all SSL verification is disabled. The new `--insecure` option makes this behavior explicit. Both options remain functional for backward compatibility.
