### Removed

- These options are removed in `ggshield iac scan diff`: `--pre-commit`, `--pre-push` and `--pre-receive`. Please use the new related commands instead.

### Added

- Three new commands are added for use as Git hooks:
  - `ggshield iac scan pre-commit`
  - `ggshield iac scan pre-push`
  - `ggshield iac scan pre-receive`
    They use the same arguments and options as other IaC scan commands.
