### Added

- Adds two new flags for `ggshield sca scan` commands, `--ignore-fixable` and `--ignore-not-fixable` so that the user can filter the returned incidents depending on if incidents can be fixed or not. Both flags cannot be used simultaneously.

### Fixed

- Fixes `ggshield sca scan` commands not taking some user parameters into account.
