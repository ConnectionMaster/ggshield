### Added

- It is now possible to manipulate the default instance using `ggshield config`: `ggshield config set instance <THE_INSTANCE_URL>` defines the default instance, `ggshield config unset instance` removes the previously defined instance. The default instance can be printed with `ggshield config get instance` and `ggshield config list`.
