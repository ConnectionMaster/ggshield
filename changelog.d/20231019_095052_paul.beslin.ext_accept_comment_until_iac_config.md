### Added

- Support for new options in gitguardian config file. IaC `ignored-paths` and `ignored_policies` can now be defined as objects with `comment` and `until` properties. If an `until` date is provided, the path/policy is only ignored up until this date. The old format is still supported. Check `.gitguardian.example.yaml` for a sample.
