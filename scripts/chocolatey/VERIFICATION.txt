VERIFICATION
Verification is intended to assist the Chocolatey moderators and community
in verifying that this package's contents are trustworthy.

1. Go to the releases page and download the windows package for the relevant version:
https://github.com/GitGuardian/ggshield/releases

2. Extract the archive

3. Get the hashes from both the downloaded release and the choco package. The hashes should match.

To verify all files, you can use the following powershell script:

$folder1 = "C:\Absolute\Path\To\Folder1"
$folder2 = "C:\Absolute\Path\To\Folder2"

$hashes1 = Get-ChildItem -Path $folder1 -Recurse -File | ForEach-Object {
    [PSCustomObject]@{
        RelativePath = $_.FullName.Substring($folder1.Length).TrimStart('\')
        Hash = (Get-FileHash $_.FullName).Hash
    }
}

$hashes2 = Get-ChildItem -Path $folder2 -Recurse -File | ForEach-Object {
    [PSCustomObject]@{
        RelativePath = $_.FullName.Substring($folder2.Length).TrimStart('\')
        Hash = (Get-FileHash $_.FullName).Hash
    }
}
