    <description>
ggshield is a CLI application that runs in your local environment or in a CI environment to help you detect more than 400+ types of secrets.

ggshield is open source on GitHub and accessible [here](https://github.com/GitGuardian/ggshield).

ggshield can run:

- in your local environment to scan local files and repositories or as a pre-commit hook.
- in a CI environment,
- in a pre-receive hook, if you have a self-managed VCS instance

Note: ggshield uses our public API through py-gitguardian to scan files. Only metadata such as call time, request size and scan mode is stored when launching a scan with ggshield, therefore secrets incidents will not be displayed on your dashboard and your files and secrets won't be stored.
